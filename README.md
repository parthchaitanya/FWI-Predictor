🔥 FWI Predictor – Algerian Forest Fire Dataset

This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using the Algerian Forest Fire dataset.
It combines feature engineering techniques, a trained Ridge Regression model, and a simple Flask + HTML interface to provide real-time predictions.

📊 Dataset

Name: Algerian Forest Fire Dataset

Features: Temperature, Relative Humidity (RH), Wind Speed (Ws), Rain, FFMC, DMC, ISI, Classes, Region

Target: Fire Weather Index (FWI)

The dataset consists of 244 instances collected from two regions of Algeria (Bejaia and Sidi-Bel Abbes) during the summer of 2012.
