# FWI Predictor – Algerian Forest Fire Dataset

This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using the Algerian Forest Fire dataset.
It combines feature engineering techniques, a trained Ridge Regression model, and a simple Flask + HTML interface to provide real-time predictions.

## 📊 Dataset

1. Name: Algerian Forest Fire Dataset

2. Features: Temperature, Relative Humidity (RH), Wind Speed (Ws), Rain, FFMC, DMC, ISI, Classes, Region

3. Target: Fire Weather Index (FWI)

4. The dataset consists of 244 instances collected from two regions of Algeria (Bejaia and Sidi-Bel Abbes) during the summer of 2012.

## ⚡ Features of the Project

1. Data preprocessing & feature engineering (scaling, cleaning)

2. Regression model (Ridge Regression) trained on the dataset

3. Web application built with Flask

4. User-friendly form in HTML for entering weather parameters

5. Real-time prediction of FWI values

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

1. Python – Core programming

2. Flask – Web framework

3. scikit-learn – Machine Learning & preprocessing

4. Pickle – Model persistence

5. HTML – Frontend interface
